 * WorkerSideChannel — the worker's view of a connection to the bus.
 *
 * Mirrors `core/bus.WorkerSideChannel`. Implementations hide whether the bus
 * is in-process, over HTTP, or behind a relay; the interface is the same.
 *
 * Semantics of Send vs Broadcast (deliberately distinct, not interchangeable):
 * - Send      — "I know who should handle this." Directed to explicit targets.
 *               targets must be non-empty (use Broadcast for undirected).
 * - Broadcast — "Whoever is interested handles it." Delivered to all online
 *               workers whose subscription matches. If no one subscribes, the
 *               event silently disappears — a valid end of the execution path.
